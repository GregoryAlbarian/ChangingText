# ChangingText

This contains two Bash Scripts that was made originally for my Computing for Scientists class.  
I wanted to share this program to show my understanding of Linux Environments. This repository  
contains two files part1.sh and part2.sh. In part1.sh the Bash scripts. The purpose of part1.sh   
is to create 500 directories all with a single text file that is the same text file. The directories  
are numbered from 1 to 500. part2.sh changes the fourth line of the text file that each directory  
already has from part1.sh. The text gets changed based around the last digit in the directory name.  
  
 __directions to run the code__  
remember to run part1.sh before running part2.sh  
Download the code to a directory.  
Use cd to get into that directory.  
Run part1 by doing   
>>./part1sh  
Run part2 by doing  
>>./part2.sh
